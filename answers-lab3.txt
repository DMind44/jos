1) We wouldn't be able to specify the privilege level of the interrupt or
exception. For example, the breakpoint interrupt should have user access,
while the page fault exception should be handled by the kernel.

2) No, the kernel handles the general protection fault because a user program
should not be able to directly invoke a kernel level vector such as page
fault. The general protection fault is invoked by the kernel when a user
program tries to access non user memory. 
If the user could call vector 14, they could do many malicious things. They
could slow the system down by repeatedly calling int 14. They could also
inject the interrupt with a malicious error code, granting user access  to
kernel only code.
